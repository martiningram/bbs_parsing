Next stuff to do:

1. Maybe make a Makefile for this, or at least give it an argument to point it
to the right place
2. Maybe make an online git repository for this (can be public)
3. See how many names from eBird I can match with the ones here. I may have to
rename some of the BBS stuff. But that's probably outside the scope of this
little BBS utility.
